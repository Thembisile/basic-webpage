  <p>The main feature of Table Mountain is the level plateau approximately 3
     kilometres (2 mi) from side to side, edged by impressive cliffs. The plateau,
      flanked by Devil's Peak to the east and by Lion's Head to the west, forms a
      dramatic backdrop to Cape Town. This broad sweep of mountainous heights,
      together with Signal Hill,
     forms the natural amphitheatre of the City Bowl and Table Bay harbour. </p>

<div id="Swahili">
  Swahili is spoken by over 100m people in Africa
  so it’s pretty hard to ignore a language that’s spoken by so many people. Its importance as a lingua franca is recognised by foreign media organisations such as the BBC, which broadcasts radio programmes in Swahili. Voice of America and Deutsche Welle have adopted
  similar tactics in their attempts to appeal to readers on the continent.

  <p id="HisText">
    In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries.

The term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress,
and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies,
a form of government with a monarch as the head.

  <h3> Castle Of Good Hope</h3>
</div>

<p id="castle-text">
  The Castle of Good Hope is a bastion fort built in the 17th century in Cape Town,
  South Africa. Originally located on the coastline of Table Bay,
  following land reclamation the fort is now located inland.
  Built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the
   oldest existing colonial building in South Africa.[2] It replaced an older fort
   called the Fort de Goede Hoop which was constructed from clay and timber and built
    by Jan van Riebeeck upon his arrival at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652
    Two redoubts, Redoubt Kyckuit (Lookout) and Redoubt Duijnhoop (Duneheap) were built at the mouth of the Salt River in 1654
    The purpose of the Dutch settlement in the Cape was to act as a replenishment station for ships

   material,
   including fixtures and fittings was imported from Europe.
